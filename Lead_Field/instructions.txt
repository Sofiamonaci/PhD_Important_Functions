These files were utilised to induce two different VT episodes from a simplistic scar (two regions of dead tissue framing an isthmus of slow conduction).
However, they can be used as examples to run leads fields on TOM2 and compute ECGs and/or EGMs.


For fast VT induction

you can simply run
./pipeline_jobs.sh
on TOM2 after making sure that each file has the correct variables initialised (look inside each file for more instructions).
Briefly, the shell script allows to
1. Compute leads fields on points of interest in a torso mesh specified in LF_electrodes.vtx -------- lead_field.pbs and lead_field.par
2. Run a RE- (no diffusion) on the extracted myocardial mesh to get a first VT cycle for two different activation time maps 
(.dat previously generated with ekbatch) -------- run_RE.pbs and eikonal.par
3. Combine lead fields and RE+ (with diffusion) to generate multiple VT cycles ----- run_LF_RE.pbs and eikonal.par 

Step 1. and 2. can be run in any order as indepedent of one another. Step 3. needs to run after BOTH Step 1. and 2. have completed.


For LF-RE environment in general

1. Run lead_field.pbs after changing LF_electrodes.vtx according to points of interest, lead_field.par according to tags of cardiac and torso meshes (and also make sure that you change
- name of MESH in lead_field.pbs
