# About

This repository contains main .mat and .py scripts used throughout my PhD to process, manipulate, plot data, generate virtual scars, run automated pipleines etc etc. 

Under ./Scar_Generation, you can find all scripts to generate simplistic, virtual scars around a mesh of interest, how to embed them into a torso and/or heart mesh, and how to run carp EP simulations

Under ./QRS_Parametrisation, you can find scripts to parametrise conduction velocities and conductivities according to a reference (clinical) QRS/ECG signal. You can either run lead field or phie recovery.

You can also visit my bitbucket Wiki and repository for more
